I might even be using FIOS now if they didn't want to install a silly dish on the roof for TV.  Now that Charter has purchased Bright House, my rating may go up to a ""10"" if the service performs consistently and experiences the promised price drop Charter is discussing.

Past experience with Brighthouse has been mixed; with new wiring in a new house it performs well, but in older residences the technicians struggled to get it working properly in many cases. I have had BHN as my provider at over 7 residences, and FIOS at one.

FIOS, then, used the faster level one network. Now they are transitioning to a slower network of servers. Charter stands to gain the most from this foolish move on the part of Verizon, in my opinion.

I might even be using FIOS now if they didn't want to install a silly dish on the roof for TV.  Now that Charter has purchased Bright House, my rating may go up to a ""10"" if the service performs consistently and experiences the promised price drop Charter is discussing.

Past experience with Brighthouse has been mixed; with new wiring in a new house it performs well, but in older residences the technicians struggled to get it working properly in many cases. I have had BHN as my provider at over 7 residences, and FIOS at one.

FIOS, then, used the faster level one network. Now they are transitioning to a slower network of servers. Charter stands to gain the most from this foolish move on the part of Verizon, in my opinion.
